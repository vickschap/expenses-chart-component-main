## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned 2 new things :
 - 1. How to use CSS flex and grid properties.
 - 2. How to loop through object arrays in JS and access particular keys and it's values.

### Continued development

I am a newbie in Javascript but determined to learn more of this vast but amazing programming language. I want to have more indepth knowledge about objects and arrays in JS. Also, I want to understand how to import JSON data into a vanilla JS file.
